below is the final, crystal-clear Quote Detail Page UI as seen inside the ADMIN PANEL, showing how the SAME page adapts based on the quote’s user type.

This is admin-facing only (not storefront), and it reflects everything you’ve implemented and locked.

✅ FINAL ONE-LINE SUMMARY

The admin quote detail page is a single unified layout with six core sections, where requester context, pricing editability, and conversion actions dynamically adapt based on whether the quote originated from a guest, individual, unverified business, or verified business—allowing admins to review, price, and decide without role-specific page fragmentation.
