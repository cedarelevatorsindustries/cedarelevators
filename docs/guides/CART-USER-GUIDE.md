## 📍 Cart Features Explained

### Profile Switching

If you have a business account, you can maintain **two separate carts**:

**How to switch:**
1. Click profile badge (top right)

### Cart Locking During Checkout

When you proceed to checkout, your cart is **soft-locked** for 5 minutes.

**What this means:**
- ⚠️ You'll see a warning: "Cart is in checkout mode"
- You can still modify items (but not recommended)
- Changes during checkout may affect your order
- Lock automatically expires after 5 minutes

**Why we do this:**
- Prevents accidental modifications during payment
- Ensures order matches what you're paying for
- Reduces errors and refunds

**How to unlock manually:**
- Go back to cart page
- Lock expires automatically
- Or click "Unlock Cart" if available

**What happens automatically:**

   - Example: Guest cart (2x Widget) + User cart (3x Widget) = 5x Widget
4. Guest cart is cleared from browser
5. You see notification: "X items added to your cart"

**Zero data loss:**
- All your guest items are preserved
